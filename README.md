Unfortunately, the CTS started using this project originally without
well-defined interfaces, so it's a dependency in which bits and pieces
are pulled into the CTS, and others are heavily modified to work in
that environment.

This is far from ideal, hopefully one day it time can be found to
address this issue properly.
